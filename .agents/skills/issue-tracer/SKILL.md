# Issue Tracer

Use this skill to drive a GitHub issue or bug report from intake to a reviewed closure plan, then, after explicit approval, to a minimal verified fix and PR-ready output.

The default behavior is plan-first. You MUST trace the issue end to end, produce a rock-solid plan, send that plan to an independent critic, incorporate the critic's feedback, present the reviewed plan to the user, and wait for explicit user approval before changing production code.

## Source Policy

Use these sources in this order.

1. GitHub source of truth:
   - If `github_mcp_direct` is available, prefer it for issue fetch, PR metadata, repository metadata, file content, and repository search before falling back to CLI commands.
   - Prefer `gh issue view`, `gh issue list`, `gh pr view`, `gh api`, `git log`, `git blame`, `git diff`, and local repo files.
   - If a GitHub MCP server is available, use it for issue, PR, discussion, and repository metadata.
   - Do not ask the user for GitHub credentials. If GitHub access fails, report the exact blocked operation and fall back to local issue text only.
2. Web source of truth:
   - Use `WebFetch` or equivalent web access for current framework/API behavior, release notes, deprecations, security advisories, and external service semantics.
   - Any plan claim based on external docs must include the URL in the plan.
3. Repository source of truth:
   - Never speculate about code. Open every file before referencing it.
   - Verify every symbol, type, command, test, config entry, and path against the repo.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Quality is the only metric that matters. Time pressure does not exist.
2. Do not implement before the user explicitly approves the reviewed plan.
3. Reproduce or explain non-reproducibility before localizing.
4. Localize before fixing. A plausible patch is not enough.
5. Prefer the smallest patch that fully closes the issue without unwired functionality, untested branches, or hidden regressions.
6. Use parallel reads/searches for independent files and subsystems whenever available.
7. Maintain written artifacts so context compaction or handoff cannot erase the investigation state.
8. If confidence drops below 90%, stop and surface the uncertainty instead of guessing.
9. Do not disable, delete, weaken, or skip tests to make the run green.
10. Do not push, merge, publish, delete data, drop databases, rewrite history, or perform destructive operations without explicit user approval.

## Required Artifacts

Create a trace directory before meaningful investigation:

```text
.Codex/issue-traces/<issue-id-or-slug>/
├── 01-issue-summary.md
├── 02-reproduction.md
├── 03-localization-log.md
├── 04-root-cause.md
├── 05-fix-plan.md
├── 06-critic-review.md
├── 07-approved-plan.md
├── 08-test-results.md
├── 09-pr-body.md
└── state.md
```

If `.Codex/` is not writable or should not be modified in the project, use `tmp/issue-traces/<issue-id-or-slug>/` and say so.

Always update `state.md` at phase boundaries with current phase, completed gates, active hypothesis, selected fix candidate, unresolved risks, and next action.

Detailed templates are in:

- `references/evidence-artifacts.md`
- `references/localization-playbook.md`
- `references/critic-gate.md`
- `assets/pr-template.md`

Read the relevant reference before starting that phase.

## Phase 0: Setup and Scope Control

1. Parse the user request into:
   - issue URL, issue number, or bug description
   - repo path or GitHub owner/repo if provided
   - requested mode: plan-only, plan-then-approval, or approved implementation
2. Check repo state:
   - `git status --short`
   - current branch
   - remotes
   - top-level files such as `AGENTS.md`, `README*`, package manifests, test configs, CI configs
3. If the worktree has unrelated user changes, do not overwrite them. Continue read-only until you can isolate your changes or ask the user.
4. Create the trace directory and initialize `state.md`.
5. Create a todo list with all phases. Mark only one step in progress at a time, and mark steps complete only after gate verification.

### Phase 0 Gate

Proceed only when:

- repo and issue target are identified or the missing identifier is explicitly documented
- worktree safety is checked
- trace directory exists
- todo list exists
- `state.md` records the starting state

## Phase 1: Intake and Reproduction

Goal: convert the issue into a precise, reproducible engineering problem.

1. Retrieve and read the full issue:
   - `gh issue view <id> --comments --json number,title,body,author,labels,state,comments,createdAt,updatedAt,url`
   - Also read linked PRs, commits, discussions, screenshots, logs, and external docs referenced by the issue.
2. Extract into `01-issue-summary.md`:
   - observed behavior
   - expected behavior
   - exact error messages and stack traces
   - reproduction steps
   - environment, platform, versions, feature flags, config
   - acceptance criteria
   - ambiguity list
3. Identify the project's verification commands by reading actual repo files:
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `README*`
   - package manifests
   - Makefiles
   - CI workflow files
   - test configs
4. Attempt reproduction using the smallest faithful command or scenario.
5. Capture exact commands, exit codes, and output in `02-reproduction.md`.
6. If no reproduction exists, create a minimal failing test, script, fixture, or manual reproduction checklist. The reproduction must target the reported behavior, not a guessed implementation detail.

### Phase 1 Gate

Proceed only when one is true:

- the issue is reproduced with exact failing output
- a regression test is written and confirmed failing for the reported behavior
- the issue is not reproducible, and `02-reproduction.md` documents every attempted command, environment mismatch, and missing input needed from the user

If reproduction is impossible because required data, credentials, environment, or hardware is missing, stop and ask for the minimum missing information. Do not jump to a speculative fix.

## Phase 2: Root-Cause Localization

Goal: isolate the root cause to the narrowest truthful granularity: file, symbol, line range, invariant, and triggering input.

Use `references/localization-playbook.md`.

1. Build candidate locations from issue evidence:
   - stack traces and error text
   - failing test names
   - UI route/API endpoint/CLI command names
   - labels and linked PRs
   - recent commits touching related areas
2. Search and read in parallel where possible:
   - `rg` for symbols, routes, commands, strings, errors, config keys
   - `git grep` for tracked-file confirmation
   - `git log --oneline --decorate -- <path>`
   - `git blame -L <start>,<end> -- <path>` where useful
3. Use reasoning-guided hierarchical localization:
   - file-level: which files can plausibly affect the symptom
   - element-level: which functions, classes, handlers, tests, or configs matter
   - line-level: which conditions, calls, assignments, invariants, or boundary checks are wrong
4. Maintain `03-localization-log.md`:
   - every hypothesis
   - files read and why
   - commands run and results
   - evidence for and against each hypothesis
   - ruled-out paths
5. Follow call chains in both directions:
   - from input/event to failure
   - from failure back to origin
   - through config, serialization, async boundaries, state transitions, and feature flags
6. Stop localization only when you can write `04-root-cause.md` in this shape:

```markdown
# Root Cause

## Summary
[One paragraph: what failed, where, and why.]

## Exact Location
- File: `path/to/file.ext`
- Symbol: `functionOrClassName`
- Lines: `start-end`

## Broken Contract
[The invariant/assumption/contract that was violated.]

## Triggering Conditions
[Inputs, environment, state, flags, or sequence required.]

## Evidence Chain
1. [Issue symptom or failing test]
2. [Code path evidence]
3. [Focused command/test evidence]
4. [Why alternatives were ruled out]
```

### Phase 2 Gate

Proceed only when:

- at least two plausible hypotheses were considered or the stack trace/repro uniquely identifies the fault
- the selected root cause has direct code evidence
- every referenced symbol/path was opened and verified
- the triggering condition is known
- alternative explanations are ruled out or explicitly documented as residual risk

If two or more hypotheses remain equally plausible, stop and ask for the smallest additional evidence needed.

## Phase 3: Fix Plan and Independent Critic Gate

Goal: produce a no-gap plan, independently review it, revise it, and ask the user for approval before implementation.

Use `references/critic-gate.md`.

1. Generate 3-5 fix candidates when realistic. For trivial single-line defects, include at least the chosen fix and one rejected alternative.
2. Rank candidates by:
   - correctness against root cause
   - minimality
   - regression risk
   - public API compatibility
   - architectural fit
   - testability
   - rollback simplicity
3. Perform impact analysis:
   - callers/importers of changed symbols
   - affected tests and fixtures
   - config and docs surfaces
   - UI/API/CLI contracts
   - persistence/migration implications
   - concurrency, async, idempotency, and retry behavior
   - security and privacy implications
4. Write `05-fix-plan.md` with:
   - issue summary
   - root cause
   - candidates considered and ranking
   - selected fix
   - exact files expected to change
   - functions/classes expected to change
   - edge cases
   - test plan
   - rollout/risk/rollback
   - explicit "unwired functionality" checklist
5. Send the plan to an independent critic:
   - If running in the main session and the `Agent` tool is available, launch a separate critic subagent with `references/critic-gate.md` and the trace artifacts as context.
   - If running as a subagent through `.Codex/agents/issue-tracer.md`, do not attempt nested subagent invocation. Codex subagents cannot spawn other subagents. Run the full fallback self-critic pass from `references/critic-gate.md` and disclose this to the user.
   - If no independent subagent is available in the current environment, run the fallback adversarial critic pass and clearly label it "Fallback self-critic: independent critic unavailable."
6. The critic must return one of:
   - `APPROVE`
   - `NEEDS_REVISION`
   - `BLOCKED`
7. Revise `05-fix-plan.md` until all critic blockers are resolved or explicitly escalated.
8. Copy the final reviewed plan to `07-approved-plan.md` with an unchecked approval line.
9. Present the final reviewed plan to the user and stop. Ask for explicit approval to implement.

### Phase 3 Gate

Do not write production code until:

- `05-fix-plan.md` exists
- `06-critic-review.md` exists
- all critic blockers are resolved or disclosed
- `07-approved-plan.md` exists
- the user explicitly approves implementation

## Phase 4: Implementation After Approval

Goal: implement the smallest complete patch that matches the approved plan.

Begin only after explicit user approval.

1. Re-check `git status --short`.
2. Create or confirm an isolated branch unless the user asked otherwise:
   - `git switch -c fix/<issue-id>-<short-slug>` or equivalent
3. Write or update the failing regression test first.
4. Run the regression test and confirm it fails for the expected reason.
5. Apply the minimal fix.
6. Re-read every changed file.
7. Run the regression test and confirm it passes.
8. Run impacted tests based on the dependency graph and changed files.
9. Run project quality checks discovered in Phase 1:
   - test suite or impacted suite
   - lint
   - typecheck
   - formatting check
   - build
   - security/static checks if the repo already has them
10. Record commands and results in `08-test-results.md`.
11. If any test fails unexpectedly, treat it as signal. Re-enter localization for that failure before changing code again.

### Phase 4 Gate

Proceed only when:

- implementation matches the approved plan or deviations are documented and approved
- regression protection exists
- impacted tests pass
- required quality checks pass or failures are documented as unrelated with evidence
- no TODO, stub, placeholder, dead branch, or unwired path was introduced

## Phase 5: Closure and PR-Ready Output

Goal: leave the issue ready for human review or PR creation.

1. Inspect the final diff:
   - `git diff --stat`
   - `git diff`
   - `git diff --check`
2. Verify no unrelated files changed.
3. Write `09-pr-body.md` using `assets/pr-template.md`.
4. Prepare a conventional commit message:
   - `fix(<scope>): <short issue-specific description>`
5. If the user explicitly asked you to commit or open a PR, do so only after confirming there are no unrelated changes.
6. Final response must include:
   - root cause with file/line references
   - exact change summary
   - tests and checks run with results
   - regression coverage
   - unresolved risks, if any
   - PR body or PR link if created

## Test Validation and Drift Review

This section applies to every phase.

Whenever any of the following change, actively review tests for drift:

- command selection logic or framework detection
- fixture expectations or test helper behavior
- workflow assertions or pipeline step ordering
- scanner coverage behavior or tool registration
- prompt content that affects agent behavior
- documentation or comments claiming system behavior

Requirements:

1. Touched tests must be verified against current and intended behavior.
2. Stale tests must be realigned to verified behavior, not left as drift.
3. Prefer behavior-level validation over brittle string-only expectations.
4. New behavior needs positive and negative cases.
5. Boundary-critical or security-sensitive behavior needs adversarial cases.
6. The release verification sweep must include a focused test-drift regression check.
7. Do not accept work where tests pass by coincidence rather than correctness.

## No-Gap Closure Checklist

Before declaring the issue ready:

- [ ] The reported symptom is reproduced or non-reproducibility is proven.
- [ ] The root cause is localized to exact code and triggering conditions.
- [ ] The fix addresses the root cause, not only the visible symptom.
- [ ] Every changed path is wired into the actual runtime path.
- [ ] Public API, CLI, UI, persistence, config, and docs surfaces are checked where relevant.
- [ ] Edge cases are tested or explicitly ruled out.
- [ ] Regression test fails before the fix and passes after the fix when feasible.
- [ ] Impacted tests, lint/type/build checks are run.
- [ ] Independent critic review completed before user approval.
- [ ] User approval obtained before implementation.
- [ ] PR-ready summary is complete.

## Escalation Triggers

Stop and ask the user or present options when:

- reproduction requires unavailable credentials, secrets, data, hardware, or external services
- the issue is actually a feature request or product decision
- a fix requires breaking public API compatibility
- a data migration or destructive operation is required
- root cause spans multiple subsystems and the approved scope is too narrow
- the critic returns `BLOCKED`
- confidence remains below 90% after reasonable investigation
