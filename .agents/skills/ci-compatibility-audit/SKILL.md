# CI Compatibility Audit

Use this skill before pushing workflow, dependency, test, build, lint, Docker, or tooling changes.

## Current CI Map

Primary workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Frontend job:

- `cd frontend`
- `npm ci --engine-strict`
- frontend toolchain graph check with `node --version`, `npm --version`, `npm ls vite vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom`, `npm exec vite -- --version`, and `npm exec vitest -- --version`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- API smoke tests for shared API, CSRF/SSE streaming, wiki SSE URL, and auth API-base behavior
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- subpath build with `VITE_APP_BASENAME=/knowledgevault` and `VITE_API_URL=/knowledgevault/api`

Backend job:

- `cd backend`
- `pip install -r requirements-ci.txt` (a **reduced** set — it deliberately
  excludes `lancedb`, `pyarrow`, `unstructured[all-docs]`, and
  `sentence-transformers`; those are stubbed at test time, see caveats below)
- `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
- `ruff check .`
- `pytest --tb=short -v` over an **enumerated, narrow subset** of test files —
  currently `tests/test_path_prefix.py tests/test_auth_routes.py
  tests/test_main_catchall.py tests/test_csrf_auth.py`, **not** the whole
  `tests/` tree. Adding a file to this list is what "expanding CI test scope"
  means; that file must pass under the reduced CI dependency set.
- informational coverage (`continue-on-error: true`) over the same subset

Repository contract job:

- `python scripts/check_config_contract.py`
- `python scripts/check_pr_scope_drift.py`

## Checks

- Lockfiles exist and match the package manager used by CI.
- CI commands exist in package manifests or requirements files.
- Cache paths point at real lockfiles.
- Scripts do not depend on local-only absolute paths.
- Workflow shell syntax is valid on the configured runner.
- Pull request diff checks have enough fetch depth.
- Local validation commands mirror CI when possible.
- Truncated CI output does not hide the command exit status.

## Local Mirror Commands

```bash
cd frontend && npm ci --engine-strict && npm run typecheck && npm run lint
cd frontend && npm test -- src/lib/api.test.ts src/lib/api.csrf.test.ts src/lib/api.sse.test.ts src/pages/WikiPage.sse.test.tsx src/stores/useAuthStore.api-base.test.ts
cd frontend && npm test && npm run build
cd frontend && VITE_APP_BASENAME=/knowledgevault VITE_API_URL=/knowledgevault/api npm run build
cd backend && ruff check . && pytest --tb=short -v tests/test_path_prefix.py tests/test_auth_routes.py tests/test_main_catchall.py tests/test_csrf_auth.py
python scripts/check_config_contract.py
python scripts/check_pr_scope_drift.py
```

## Environment caveats (so local results aren't misread)

- **CI's dependency set is reduced — "locally green" ≠ "CI green".** CI installs
  only `requirements-ci.txt` + `requirements-dev.txt`, which omit `lancedb`,
  `pyarrow`, `unstructured`, and `sentence-transformers`. A dev machine usually
  has the *full* `requirements.txt` installed, so a backend test can pass locally
  yet fail in CI at import (`ModuleNotFoundError`) or behave differently. To
  validate a backend **test-scope** change (e.g. adding a file to the CI pytest
  list) faithfully, reproduce the CI env instead of trusting the local run:
  ```bash
  python -m venv /tmp/civenv
  /tmp/civenv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements-ci.txt -r backend/requirements-dev.txt
  cd backend && /tmp/civenv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/<candidate_file>.py
  ```
  This is also *faster* than the local suite (no multi-GB model/db loads).
  Corollary: a test only passes under the reduced set because something stubs
  the missing packages — those per-file `lancedb`/`pyarrow`/`unstructured` stubs
  are **load-bearing for CI, not dead boilerplate**. Do not "clean them up"
  without confirming the file still collects under the CI venv.
- **`assert_url_safe` (SSRF guard) does real DNS + blocks loopback/private.** It
  calls `socket.getaddrinfo` and rejects loopback/private/link-local hosts unless
  `ALLOW_LOCAL_SERVICES=1`. Putting it on a hot path or in a Pydantic validator
  makes tests that use fake hostnames (`*.example`) or `localhost` URLs fail or
  stall. Validate URL changes at change-time, not on every read. (`.example`
  fails fast with `gaierror`, so a *hang* is heavy-dep loading, not DNS.)
- **CI pins Python 3.11.** On a newer local interpreter (e.g. 3.14) some backend
  tests fail with `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop` — a local
  artifact, not a regression. Prefer a 3.11 venv; the `ruff check .` lint gate
  and CI-targeted tests are what matter.

## Output

Classify each risk as:

- `BLOCKER`: likely CI failure or invalid workflow.
- `RISK`: plausible CI instability requiring targeted validation.
- `NOTE`: useful context, not blocking.

Include the exact workflow step or command for every item.
