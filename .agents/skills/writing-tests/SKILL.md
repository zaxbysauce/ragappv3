# Writing Tests

This skill covers two test ecosystems found in this workspace:

- **TypeScript (bun:test)** — used by opencode-swarm and similar projects
- **Python (unittest/pytest)** — used by ragappv3 backend and similar projects

RAGAPPv3 frontend is an npm/Vite/Vitest project under `frontend/`, not Bun. For RAGAPPv3 frontend work, follow the repo's actual `frontend/package.json` scripts: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`. Use Vitest conventions already present in `frontend/src/**/*.test.ts*`.

RAGAPPv3 CI also runs repository quality contract scripts from the repo root: `python scripts/check_config_contract.py` and `python scripts/check_pr_scope_drift.py`.

Load the relevant section based on the test file's framework. Check for `import unittest` / `import pytest` (Python) vs `import from 'bun:test'` (TypeScript).

---

# Part 1: TypeScript — bun:test

All test files MUST import from `bun:test`:

```typescript
import { describe, test, expect, beforeEach, afterEach } from 'bun:test';
```

Bun provides a vitest compatibility layer (`vi.mock`, `vi.fn`, `vi.spyOn`) that works on Linux and macOS. However, `vi.mock()` has critical isolation bugs in Bun when multiple test directories run in the same process. Prefer `bun:test` native APIs:

| vitest API | bun:test equivalent | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| `vi.fn()` | `mock(() => ...)` | Import `mock` from `bun:test` |
| `vi.spyOn(obj, method)` | `spyOn(obj, method)` | Import `spyOn` from `bun:test` |
| `vi.mock('module', factory)` | `mock.module('module', factory)` | Import `mock` from `bun:test` |
| `vi.restoreAllMocks()` | `mock.restore()` | Call in `afterEach` |

## Mock Isolation Rules

**CRITICAL: Module-level mocks leak across test files within the same Bun process.**

The CI pipeline runs test directories in groups. All files in a group share one Bun process and one module cache. A `vi.mock()` or `mock.module()` call in file A replaces the module for file B if they run in the same group.

### Rules

1. **Never mock a module that another test file in the same CI group imports directly.** If `tests/unit/cli/run-dispatch.test.ts` mocks `../../src/commands/agents.js`, then `tests/unit/commands/agents.test.ts` (in the same group) will get the mock instead of the real module.

2. **If you must use module-level mocks, isolate the test in its own CI step** or use dependency injection instead of module replacement.

3. **Never create circular mock imports.** This pattern deadlocks Bun:
```typescript
// BROKEN — imports from the module it's about to mock
import { realFn } from '../../src/module.js';
vi.mock('../../src/module.js', () => ({
  realFn: (...args) => realFn(...args),  // circular!
  otherFn: vi.fn(),
}));
```
Instead, inline the function logic or extract the real functions into a separate utility module.

4. **Prefer constructor/parameter injection over module mocking.** The swarm's hook factories (`createScopeGuardHook`, `createDelegationLedgerHook`, etc.) accept injected dependencies — test them by passing mock callbacks, not by replacing modules.

## CI Pipeline Structure

The CI runs on three platforms (ubuntu, macos, windows). Tests are split into sequential steps within each platform's job.

**Per-file isolation:** Each test file runs in its own Bun process via `for f in dir/*.test.ts; do bun --smol test "$f"; done`. This prevents module cache poisoning between files within the same step.

**Cascade termination:** Each step uses `exit $failed` — the first failing step terminates the entire platform's job. This means failures in later steps are hidden until earlier steps pass. When fixing Windows issues, expect to peel back layers: fixing Step 4 may reveal a failure in Step 5 that was previously hidden.

```
Step 1: hooks - guardrails            (Linux/macOS only, skipped on Windows)
Step 2: hooks - knowledge             (Linux/macOS only, skipped on Windows)
Step 3: hooks - system-enhancer       (Linux/macOS only, skipped on Windows)
Step 4: hooks - delegation + others   (Linux/macOS only, skipped on Windows)
Step 5: commands + config             (all platforms)
Step 6: cli                           (all platforms)
Step 7: tools                         (all platforms)
Step 8: services + build + quality + sast + sbom + scripts  (all platforms)
Step 9: state + agents + knowledge + evidence + plan + misc (all platforms)
```

When writing a test, know which step your file will run in. Do not assume isolation from other files in the same step.

**Job timeout: 15 minutes.** A single hanging test will kill the entire platform's test run.

## File Placement

### Convention

| Test type | Location | When to use |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Unit tests for `src/hooks/*.ts` | `tests/unit/hooks/` | Testing hook factories and hook behavior |
| Unit tests for `src/tools/*.ts` | `tests/unit/tools/` | Testing tool execute functions |
| Unit tests for `src/commands/*.ts` | `tests/unit/commands/` | Testing CLI command handlers |
| Unit tests for `src/config/*.ts` | `tests/unit/config/` | Testing schema validation, config loading |
| Unit tests for `src/agents/*.ts` | `tests/unit/agents/` | Testing agent prompt generation, factory logic |
| Colocated tests | `src/**/*.test.ts` | Integration-style tests tightly coupled to the source module |
| Integration tests | `tests/integration/` | Cross-module workflows, plugin initialization |
| Security tests | `tests/security/` | Adversarial input handling, injection resistance |
| Smoke tests | `tests/smoke/` | Built package validation |

### Naming

- Base test: `<module>.test.ts`
- Adversarial variant: `<module>.adversarial.test.ts`

Only create an adversarial variant if it tests **distinct attack vectors** not covered by the base test. Do not duplicate base test assertions with different inputs — that's redundancy, not security coverage.

### Regression tests (review-surfaced bugs)

When fixing a bug surfaced by code review, swarm review, or post-merge audit, **always add a regression test** with the following shape so the test's purpose survives future cleanup:

```typescript
describe('<feature> — regression: <one-line description> (F#)', () => {
  it('<exact behavior the bug violated>', () => {
    // Previous code did <bad thing>: e.g. the regex `/^\.\/+/` only stripped
    // a single leading `./`, so `././util.ts` survived as `./util.ts`.
    expect(normalizeGraphPath('././util.ts')).toBe('util.ts');
  });
});
```

Rules:
- The describe label includes the original finding ID (e.g. `F8`, `F9`, `F1.1`) so future readers can map back to the review.
- The leading comment in the body explains the **prior buggy behavior** in concrete terms — what the code did before, not what it does now.
- One regression test per finding. Do not pile unrelated assertions into a single regression block.

Examples in-tree: `tests/unit/graph/graph-query.test.ts` (`normalizeGraphPath — regression (F8)`, `getBlastRadius — regression: depthReached (F9)`), `tests/unit/graph/import-extractor.test.ts` (`paren-preceded strings (F1)`, `member-expression require/import (F1.1)`).

## Test Quality Standards

### DO

- Test real behavior: call the actual function with real inputs, assert on real outputs.
- Test error paths: what happens with `null`, `undefined`, empty string, oversized input?
- Use temp directories (`fs.mkdtemp`) for file I/O tests. Clean up in `afterEach`.
- Assert on specific values, not just truthiness: `expect(result.status).toBe('pending')` not `expect(result).toBeTruthy()`.

### DO NOT

- **Do not test type definitions.** `expect(event.type === 'foo').toBe(true)` tests TypeScript, not your code.
- **Do not test framework behavior.** "Zod schema parses valid input" tests Zod, not your schema.
- **Do not test test utilities.** If it only exists to support other tests, it doesn't need its own test.
- **Do not mock everything.** If every dependency is mocked, you're testing the mock setup. Prefer real dependencies for pure functions and only mock I/O boundaries (filesystem, network, timers).
- **Do not hardcode version numbers.** Version bumps are automated — a test asserting `version === '6.31.3'` breaks on every release.
- **Do not use `sleep` or `setTimeout` for synchronization.** Use explicit signals, resolved promises, or `Bun.sleep()` with tight bounds.
- **Do not spawn `cat /dev/zero`, `yes`, or other infinite-output commands.** Use `sleep 30` for "blocking command" tests.

## Cross-Entry Invariants (config maps)

When you modify any entry of a "map of agents/tools/roles" in `src/config/constants.ts` (`AGENT_TOOL_MAP`, `DEFAULT_MODELS`, `QA_AGENTS`, `PIPELINE_AGENTS`, etc.), there are tests that assert **parity across sibling entries**, not just shape of one entry.

Known parity assertions:

| Test | Invariant |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit/config/critic-registration.test.ts:67` | `AGENT_TOOL_MAP.critic_sounding_board.length === AGENT_TOOL_MAP.critic.length` |
| `tests/unit/config/agent-tool-map.test.ts:26` | `AGENT_TOOL_MAP.architect.length` is strictly greater than every other agent's |
| `tests/unit/config/agent-tool-map.test.ts:34` | every subagent's tool list `<= 20` entries |
| `tests/unit/config/constants.test.ts:48` | `ALL_SUBAGENT_NAMES.length === 13` |
| `tests/unit/config/constants.test.ts:137` | `Object.keys(DEFAULT_MODELS).length === 14` |

Workflow when adding a tool to a single agent:
1. Add the entry.
2. Run `bun --smol test tests/unit/config --timeout 60000` **before pushing**.
3. If a parity test fails, decide: mirror the change to sibling agents (most common — see this PR's `repo_map` mirrored to `critic_sounding_board` + `critic_drift_verifier`), or update the invariant test if the design intent has actually changed.
4. To inspect runtime shape quickly: `bun -e "import { AGENT_TOOL_MAP } from './src/config/constants.ts'; for (const [k,v] of Object.entries(AGENT_TOOL_MAP)) console.log(k, v.length);"`

Do **not** push a constants change to CI without running the config test directory locally — these failures cascade through the per-OS unit jobs and waste minutes per push.

## Cross-Platform Requirements

All tests must pass on Linux, macOS, and Windows unless explicitly gated.

### Skipping tests on specific platforms

Use the `skipIf` chaining pattern:
```typescript
// Skip on Windows only
test.skipIf(process.platform === 'win32')('test name', async () => { ... });

// Skip on non-Linux (use when test relies on Linux-specific behavior)
test.skipIf(process.platform !== 'linux')('test name', async () => { ... });

// Skip entire describe block
describe.skipIf(process.platform === 'win32')('group name', () => { ... });
```

### Temp directories and path handling
- Use `path.join()` or `path.resolve()`, never string concatenation with `/`.
- Temp directories: use `os.tmpdir()`, never hardcoded `/tmp`.
- **CRITICAL: Wrap `mkdtempSync` with `realpathSync` when using `process.chdir`:**
  ```typescript
  // WRONG — on macOS, /tmp is a symlink to /private/tmp.
  // mkdtempSync returns /tmp/... but process.cwd() resolves to /private/tmp/...
  const tempDir = fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'test-'));
  process.chdir(tempDir);
  // process.cwd() !== tempDir on macOS!

  // CORRECT — resolve symlinks first
  const tempDir = fs.realpathSync(
    fs.mkdtempSync(path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'test-')),
  );
  process.chdir(tempDir);
  ```
- File comparisons: normalize paths before comparing (`path.resolve(a) === path.resolve(b)`).

### Permissions (`fs.chmodSync`)
- `chmodSync` is a **no-op for directories** on Windows and unreliable for files.
- Tests that rely on chmod to simulate permission errors should guard with platform checks:
  ```typescript
  if (process.platform !== 'win32') {
    fs.chmodSync(filePath, 0o000);
    // ... test permission error behavior ...
    fs.chmodSync(filePath, 0o644); // restore
  } else {
    // On Windows, skip or use a mock to throw EPERM
  }
  ```
- If the test asserts that the tool handles permission errors **gracefully** (returns success despite write failure), the test may pass on Windows even without chmod — the write just succeeds. Verify this before adding guards.

### Symlinks
- `fs.symlinkSync` requires **administrator or developer mode** on Windows.
- Use a runtime capability check:
  ```typescript
  let canCreateSymlinks = false;
  try {
    const testLink = path.join(tempDir, '.symlink-test');
    fs.symlinkSync(tempDir, testLink);
    fs.unlinkSync(testLink);
    canCreateSymlinks = true;
  } catch {}

  test.skipIf(!canCreateSymlinks)('symlink test', async () => { ... });
  ```

### Process spawning
- Use `.cmd` extension on Windows for npm/bun binaries: `process.platform === 'win32' ? 'bun.cmd' : 'bun'`.
- Use array-form `spawn`/`spawnSync`, never shell string commands.
- **`npx` in empty temp dirs hangs on Windows.** If a test creates a temp directory with a `package.json` (for framework detection) and then calls a tool that spawns `npx vitest run` or similar, the spawn will hang until the test timeout fires. Skip these tests on non-Linux:
  ```typescript
  // Flaky on macOS/Windows: spawns vitest in temp dir without node_modules
  test.skipIf(process.platform !== 'linux')(
    'test that triggers process execution',
    async () => { ... },
    15000,
  );
  ```

### Timestamps
- Avoid comparing strings that embed `new Date().toISOString()`. Two sequential calls can span a millisecond boundary, especially on Windows CI. Strip or normalize volatile timestamps before comparison:
  ```typescript
  const stripTimestamp = (s: string) =>
    s.replace(/Updated: \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T[\d:.]+Z/, 'Updated: <FROZEN>');
  expect(stripTimestamp(output1)).toBe(stripTimestamp(output2));
  ```

## Running TypeScript Tests

> **⚠️ Do NOT use the OpenCode `test_runner` tool to validate the full repo.** It is for targeted agent validation with explicit `files: [...]` or small targeted scopes. `scope: 'all'` requires `allow_full_suite: true` and is intended for opt-in CI mirrors only. Broad scopes can stall or kill OpenCode before the `MAX_SAFE_TEST_FILES = 50` (`src/tools/test-runner.ts:26`) guard fires. For repo validation, use the shell commands below — per-file isolation loops match CI behavior. `allow_full_suite` should be used only when intentional and justified in the PR description. See [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) invariant 6 for the full contract.

```bash
# Full suite (all platforms)
bun test

# Single file
bun test tests/unit/hooks/scope-guard.test.ts

# Single directory
bun --smol test tests/unit/hooks --timeout 30000

# CI-equivalent run (per-file isolation, matches actual CI behavior)
for f in tests/unit/tools/*.test.ts; do bun --smol test "$f" --timeout 120000; done

# Quick directory run (faster but may have cross-file cache pollution)
bun --smol test tests/unit/cli --timeout 120000
bun --smol test tests/unit/commands tests/unit/config --timeout 120000
```

The `--smol` flag reduces Bun's memory footprint. Use it when running large directories (50+ files).

The `--timeout 120000` flag sets per-test timeout to 120 seconds. Individual tests should complete in under 5 seconds. If a test needs more than 10 seconds, it's doing too much — split it or mock the slow dependency.

**Note:** CI runs each file in its own Bun process (`for f in dir/*.test.ts; do bun --smol test "$f"; done`). Running an entire directory at once (`bun --smol test tests/unit/tools/`) can mask cache-poisoning issues that only appear in CI. When debugging CI failures, test files individually.

## Debugging CI failures

When CI reports a `unit (ubuntu-latest|macos-latest|windows-latest)` failure:

1. **Identify the actual failing test from the job log first.** Do not assume it's a pre-existing failure based on a local repro of a different test. Open the failing job's URL (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/actions/runs/<run-id>/job/<job-id>`) and find the `<file>:<line>` in the Bun output. WebFetch can scrape this if the `gh` CLI isn't available.
2. **Reproduce that exact file locally** with the per-file CI command:
   ```bash
   bun --smol test tests/unit/<dir>/<file>.test.ts --timeout 30000
   ```
3. **Then check if the same failure reproduces on `main`.** If yes, document as pre-existing in the PR description and continue with your branch's work; do not silently inherit the failure.
4. **For dist-check failures:** any change under `src/` that the bundler picks up requires `bun run build` + commit of `dist/` in the same PR. The job compares committed `dist/` against a fresh build.
5. **For matrix-OS-only failures:** check `process.platform` guards, `mkdtempSync` realpath wrapping, chmod guards, symlink capability checks, and `npx`-spawn skips (sections above).

## Before Submitting

1. Run the tests for your changed files: `bun test path/to/your.test.ts`
2. Run the full CI group your tests belong to (see pipeline structure above)
3. Verify no `process.cwd()` usage — use the `directory` parameter from `createSwarmTool` or hook constructor
4. Verify no hardcoded paths (`/tmp/...`, `C:\...`) — use `os.tmpdir()` + `path.join()`
5. Verify mocks are restored in `afterEach` if using `spyOn` or `mock.module`
6. Verify `mkdtempSync` is wrapped with `realpathSync` if you use `process.chdir` on the result
7. Verify `chmodSync` calls are guarded with `process.platform !== 'win32'`
8. Verify symlink creation is guarded or uses a `canCreateSymlinks` capability check
9. Verify no `new Date().toISOString()` in equality assertions — strip volatile timestamps
10. Verify tests that spawn `npx`/`vitest`/`jest` in temp dirs are skipped on non-Linux

# Part 2: Python — unittest / pytest

## Framework

This project uses `unittest.TestCase` classes with `pytest` as the runner. All backend test files live under `backend/tests/`.

```python
import unittest

class TestMyFeature(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_something(self):
        self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

Run with:
```bash
# From project root
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_module.py -v --tb=short

# Specific test class
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_module.py::TestMyClass -v

# Specific test
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_module.py::TestMyClass::test_something -v
```

### Async Test Methods

Test methods that call async functions must be declared `async` and decorated with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_operation(self):
    result = await some_async_function()
    self.assertEqual(result, expected)
```

Without the decorator, pytest will not await the coroutine and the test will fail with "coroutine was never awaited".

Use `AsyncMock` for mocking async functions:
```python
mock_service = AsyncMock()
mock_service.fetch_data.return_value = {"id": 1}
result = await mock_service.fetch_data()
```

This project uses `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pytest configuration (pyproject.toml), so the decorator is not strictly required — pytest auto-detects async tests. However, explicit decoration is preferred for clarity and for compatibility with older pytest versions.

### Pytest Fixtures

Use `@pytest.fixture` for reusable setup/teardown logic:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def db_connection(tmp_path):
    """Fixture that provides a test database connection."""
    db_path = tmp_path / "test.db"
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
    yield conn  # test runs here
    conn.close()  # cleanup
```

Fixture scopes:
- `scope="function"` (default): fresh fixture for each test
- `scope="class"`: shared across all tests in a class
- `scope="module"`: shared across all tests in a file
- `scope="session"`: shared across entire test run

### Monkeypatch

Use the `monkeypatch` fixture to mock attributes and environment variables without module-level mocking:

```python
def test_with_monkeypatch(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr(some_object, "method", AsyncMock(return_value=42))
    monkeypatch.setenv("API_KEY", "test-key")
    result = some_object.method()
    assert result == 42
```

Monkeypatch automatically restores original values after the test — no manual cleanup needed.

### FastAPI TestClient with Dependency Overrides

To test FastAPI endpoints with custom dependencies (e.g., test database):

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

def override_get_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect("test.db")
    try:
        yield conn
    finally:
        conn.close()

app.dependency_overrides[deps.get_db] = override_get_db
client = TestClient(app)
# ... run tests ...
app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

Always clear `dependency_overrides` after the test to prevent leaks.

## Mock Exception Types MUST Match Production Catch Clauses

**CRITICAL: This is the #1 cause of silent test failures in Python test fixes.**

If production code catches specific exception types:
```python
try:
    risky_operation()
except (OSError, RuntimeError, ValueError):
    handle_failure()
```

The test mock MUST raise one of those types, NOT bare `Exception`:
```python
# WRONG — Exception is NOT caught by the specific handler
mock_obj.method.side_effect = Exception("something failed")
# Result: exception propagates, test sees 500 instead of 200

# CORRECT — OSError IS caught by the handler
mock_obj.method.side_effect = OSError("something failed")
# Result: handler catches it, execution continues, test sees 200
```

When fixing a failing test, **always read the production catch clause first**. Match the mock exception type exactly. The production code's `except` tuple is the authoritative list of exception types the code handles.

## Test Class Organization

### Naming

- Base test: `Test<EndpointOrModule>` (e.g., `TestVaultEndpoints`, `TestAuthRoutes`)
- Adversarial variant: `Test<Feature>Adversarial` (e.g., `TestFetchAccessibleVaultsAdversarial`)
- Scoped tests: `Test<Feature><Scope>` (e.g., `TestVaultScopedRoutes`)

### Database Access

Tests that need direct database access use the pattern:
```python
conn = self._get_db_conn()
try:
    # insert test data
    self._insert_vault(conn, "TestVault")
finally:
    self._connection_pool.release_connection(conn)
```

Always release connections in `finally` — SQLite has a connection limit and unreleased connections can cause "database is locked" errors in subsequent tests.

### Unused Variables

Ruff flags unused variables with F841. If a helper returns a value you don't need, call it without assignment:
```python
# WRONG — triggers F841
vault_id = self._insert_vault(conn, "TestVault")

# CORRECT — bare call, no unused variable
self._insert_vault(conn, "TestVault")
```

## SQL Parameter Counting

When writing SQL queries with parameterized placeholders, count every `?` in the query and bind exactly that many values:
```python
# Count the placeholders: 4 question marks
query = """
    SELECT DISTINCT v.id FROM vaults v WHERE v.id IN (
        SELECT vm.vault_id FROM vault_members vm WHERE vm.user_id = ?  -- 1
        UNION
        SELECT vga.vault_id FROM vault_group_access vga
        JOIN group_members gm ON vga.group_id = gm.group_id
        WHERE gm.user_id = ?                                        -- 2
        UNION
        SELECT v.id FROM vaults v WHERE v.visibility = 'public' AND v.org_id IS NOT NULL AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM org_members om WHERE om.org_id = v.org_id AND om.user_id = ?  -- 3
        )
        UNION
        SELECT v.id FROM vaults v WHERE v.visibility = 'org' AND v.org_id IS NOT NULL AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM org_members om WHERE om.org_id = v.org_id AND om.user_id = ?  -- 4
        )
    )
"""

# Bind EXACTLY 4 parameters — one per placeholder
cursor.execute(query, (user_id, user_id, user_id, user_id))
```

Mismatch causes `sqlite3.ProgrammingError: Incorrect number of bindings` at runtime.

## Defensive Null Checks in Test Assertions

When verifying that an operation succeeded despite a partial failure (e.g., vault deletion despite vector store error), add a **state verification** assertion beyond just checking the HTTP response:

```python
def test_delete_vault_vector_store_failure_continues(self):
    # ... setup ...
    mock_vector_store.delete_by_vault.side_effect = OSError("vector store down")
    resp = self.client.delete(f"/api/vaults/{vault_id}")

    # 1. HTTP response check
    self.assertEqual(resp.status_code, 200)
    self.assertIn("deleted successfully", resp.json()["message"])

    # 2. State verification — confirm the side effect actually occurred
    resp_check = self.client.get(f"/api/vaults/{vault_id}")
    self.assertEqual(resp_check.status_code, 404)
```

Without the 404 check, the test only verifies the response message — it doesn't verify the DB state changed.

## Running Python Tests

```bash
# From project root — single test file
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_vaults.py -v --tb=short -q

# Single test class
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_vaults.py::TestVaultEndpoints -v

# Single test method
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_vaults.py::TestVaultEndpoints::test_delete_vault -v

# Quick pass — stop on first failure
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_vaults.py -x --tb=line -q

# With coverage (informational)
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_vaults.py --cov=backend --cov-report=term-missing
```

The `-x` flag stops on first failure (useful during development). Omit it when checking the full test suite.

### Async Test Execution

This project uses `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pyproject.toml (pytest-asyncio), so async tests are auto-detected. No special flags needed:

```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_async_module.py -v
```

For projects without auto mode, add `-o asyncio_mode=auto` or use the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator.

## Ruff Linting for Test Files

Ruff catches issues that block CI. Run locally before pushing:
```bash
ruff check backend/tests/test_vaults.py
```

Common ruff errors in test files:
- **F841**: Unused variable — remove the assignment, call the function bare
- **W293**: Trailing whitespace on blank lines — remove whitespace
- **F541**: f-string without placeholders — remove the `f` prefix
- **W291**: Trailing whitespace on comment lines — trim trailing spaces

Fix automatically where possible:
```bash
ruff check --fix backend/tests/test_vaults.py
```

## Source-inspection test pattern (RAGAPPv3)

Some backend tests open Python source files as strings and regex-match for
structural invariants — e.g., "every `StreamingResponse` call must include
`X-Accel-Buffering`", or "every route file exports a `router` object". This
pattern appears in `backend/tests/test_path_prefix.py` and similar files.

**When to use it:**
- Enforcing cross-cutting structural invariants that are hard to exercise
  behaviorally (e.g., "all streaming responses must set a header").
- Checking that boilerplate or security-sensitive patterns are not omitted.
- When a behavioral test would require an integration setup disproportionate
  to the risk being tested.

**When NOT to use it:**
- As a substitute for behavioral tests when a behavioral test is straightforward.
- For logic correctness — source inspection cannot catch a header present but
  set to the wrong value.
- Where refactoring (e.g., renaming a function) would silently break the test
  without breaking production behavior.

**Tradeoff:** Fast and easy to write; fragile to non-behavioral refactoring.
Always prefer behavioral unit tests when practical. When using source
inspection, add a comment explaining why a behavioral test is not used.

## Debugging CI Python Test Failures

1. **Check if the failure is pre-existing**: Run the same test on `master` first. If it fails there too, it's not introduced by your branch.
2. **Read the exact error message**: Python tracebacks include file, line number, and assertion values. The assertion diff (`expected X, got Y`) tells you everything.
3. **Check mock setup**: The most common Python test bug is a mock that doesn't match the actual method signature or production behavior. Read the production code's `except` clause before writing the mock.
4. **Check database state**: If a test creates data in a `try` block, verify the data exists before asserting behavior that depends on it. Missing `self._insert_*` calls are a common source of "expected 200, got 404" failures.
