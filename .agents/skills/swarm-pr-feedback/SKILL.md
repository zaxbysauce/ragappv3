# /swarm-pr-feedback

Use this skill to resolve an external review bundle on a PR branch. It covers
the full loop: ingest → verify → fix → test → amend → push → update PR body.

This skill is the counterpart to `swarm-pr-review` (which *generates* a review)
and `commit-pr` (which opens a fresh PR). Use it when a review already exists
and you need to act on its findings.

---

## Inputs

The user provides one or more of:
- A structured review bundle (from `swarm-pr-review` output, a human reviewer,
  or an AI code review tool) containing findings with severity, file:line
  references, and classification status.
- A PR number or branch name.
- An explicit list of findings to accept, defer, or reject.

---

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Verify every finding against actual current code before fixing. A finding
   classified as CONFIRMED by the reviewer is still a candidate until you open
   the file and read the cited lines.
2. Fix confirmed findings only. Do not broaden scope with adjacent cleanup.
3. For every fix, add or update a regression test that would have caught the
   bug. The test must fail without the fix and pass with it, or document why
   a test is not feasible.
4. Amend the existing commit (not a new one) so the PR history stays clean,
   then force-push with `--force-with-lease`. Note: amending is explicitly
   correct here — PR review follow-up is a well-defined amend use case.
   This overrides the general convention to prefer new commits.
5. Update the PR body with an explicit `## Review follow-up` section listing
   Accepted, Rejected, and Deferred findings with short evidence.
6. Run all frontend/backend CI gates locally before pushing. A CI-only failure
   costs a full push → fail → fixup round trip.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Ingest and classify

Parse the review bundle into a structured list. For each finding record:
- Finding ID (e.g., F-001)
- Severity (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW)
- Claim (what the reviewer said is wrong)
- Cited file:line
- Reviewer classification (CONFIRMED / DISPROVED / UNVERIFIED / PRE_EXISTING)
- Coverage gap vs correctness bug (coverage gaps may be deferred)

If the bundle lacks explicit classification, treat every finding as UNVERIFIED
until you verify it yourself.

### Step 2 — Verify findings against current code

Open every cited file and line. Do not trust line numbers from a review bundle —
the branch may have changed. For each finding:

- **CONFIRMED by reviewer + code matches**: accept for fixing.
- **CONFIRMED by reviewer but code does not match**: classify as `not reproduced`;
  document the discrepancy; do not fix.
- **UNVERIFIED**: open the file, read the logic, make your own judgment.
- **Coverage gap (not a correctness bug)**: decide whether to add the test now
  or defer. Prefer adding if the test is simple and the code path is real.
- **PRE_EXISTING / out of scope**: document; do not fix.

Use the `review-finding-validator` skill for large bundles (>5 findings) or
when findings are ambiguous or high-risk.

### Step 3 — Plan fixes

For each accepted finding, state:
- The exact code change (file, function, what changes and why).
- The regression test to add (what it asserts, why it would catch this).
- Any behavioral-change test trap: pre-existing tests that assert the old
  behavior and will fail after the fix. Update them with a comment.

For correctness fixes that touch auth, session handling, payments, migrations,
or concurrency: treat as high-risk and apply extra scrutiny before fixing.

### Step 4 — Implement

Apply fixes in dependency order (fix foundations before things that depend on
them). After each fix:
- Re-read the changed function to confirm the fix is complete and no dead
  branches were introduced.
- Confirm the regression test fails without the fix (reason through it if a
  live failing run isn't practical).

### Step 5 — Validate

Run all applicable gates from the project's CI contract. Use the exact npm
script and direct-executable forms that CI uses — bare `npx`/`python -m`
invocations may miss config flags the scripts encode.

**Frontend** (from `frontend/`):
```
npm run typecheck         # tsc --noEmit, matches CI
npm run lint              # eslint with project config, matches CI
npm test                  # vitest run, matches CI
npm run build             # production build (for path-critical changes)
```

**Backend** (from `backend/`):
```
ruff check .              # matches CI directly
pytest <touched modules>  # matches CI directly
```

Do not push until all gates are green. A single CI-only lint or type error
costs an extra push → fail → fixup commit.

### Step 6 — Amend and push

```bash
git add <changed files>               # stage explicitly; never git add -A
git commit --amend                    # keep PR to one meaningful commit
                                      # (explicit amend use case — overrides
                                      #  the general prefer-new-commit rule)
git push --force-with-lease -u origin <branch>
```

Never use plain `--force`. If `--force-with-lease` fails, check for concurrent
pushes before retrying.

### Step 7 — Update PR body

Add or update a `## Review follow-up` section in the PR description:

```md
## Review follow-up

**F-001 — ACCEPTED** (short title)
[What was wrong, what changed, what test was added.]

**F-002 — REJECTED** (short title)
[Why: not reproduced / pre-existing / out of scope + evidence.]

**F-003 — DEFERRED** (short title)
[Why deferred (coverage gap, separate issue, out of PR scope) + issue link if filed.]
```

---

## Handling coverage gaps

Coverage gaps (correct code, missing test) are lower priority than correctness
bugs. Default behavior:

- **Simple, in-scope gap**: add the test now. One assertion is better than zero.
- **Complex or out-of-scope gap**: file a GitHub issue, add the issue link to
  the PR body under Deferred, and move on.

Do not add speculative tests for hypothetical inputs the code will never see.

---

## Handling a review with no confirmed findings

If every finding is DISPROVED or PRE_EXISTING:
- Document all classifications in the PR body.
- Do not amend the commit (nothing changed).
- Confirm the PR is ready for merge as-is.

## Quick reference — common finding patterns

| Pattern | Usual fix | Regression test shape |
|---|---|---|
| Backoff/timer not reset after clean path | Reset variable in the correct branch | Fake timers; verify next attempt fires in base delay |
| Missing null guard on optional | Add guard; decide error vs silent skip | Pass `null` / `undefined`; assert no crash |
| Silent event drop (wrong dispatcher) | Route event to correct handler | Emit the event; assert callback fires |
| Cookie path mismatch under subpath | Use path helper, not hardcoded string | Monkeypatch `app_root_path`; assert cookie path |
| Token in URL (security) | Move to header or POST body | Assert no token in logged URL |
