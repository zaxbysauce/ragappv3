# JSONL and Structured Block Schemas

Use these exact fields unless a field is not applicable, in which case write `N/A` or an explicit reason. Prefer one block per record in markdown ledgers and JSON object per line in `.jsonl` artifacts.

## Coverage unit

```json
{"unit_id":"COV-001","track":"security","unit_type":"trust_boundary","path_or_id":"BOUNDARY-001","status":"UNREVIEWED","depth_tier":"focused|multi_track|complete_integrated|custom","passes_required":["candidate","deterministic_tool","caller_callee_trace","test_or_guard_check","reviewer_validation","critic_if_required"],"passes_completed":[],"evidence_refs":[],"deterministic_checks":[],"runtime_checks_or_reason":"","validation_refs":[],"remaining_uncertainty":"","reason":"","updated_at":"<iso8601>"}
```

Terminal `status` values: `REVIEWED`, `NOT_APPLICABLE`, `SKIPPED_WITH_REASON`, `BLOCKED`. Final report is forbidden for selected tracks while any unit remains `UNASSIGNED` or `UNREVIEWED`. `REVIEWED` is valid only when `passes_completed` satisfies the selected track's `TRACK_DEPTH_PLAN`.

## Track depth plan

Write one block per selected track to `ledgers/review-depth-plan.md` after track selection and before Phase 1.

```text
TRACK_DEPTH_PLAN
  track: <A|B|C|D|E|F|G|1X>
  depth_tier: focused | multi_track | complete_integrated | custom
  coverage_unit_basis: <public_surface | trust_boundary | test_cluster | ui_component_family | hot_path | dependency_family | ai_surface | domain_component | cross_boundary_pair>
  expected_units: <count or unknown_until_inventory>

  reviewer_batch_rule: <local reasoning unit definition>
  critic_rule: <inline/final/enhancement/systemic>
  non_dilution_check: <why this track is not shallower because of selected breadth>
