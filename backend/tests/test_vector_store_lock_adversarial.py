"""
Adversarial tests for VectorStore _acquire_write_lock timeout behavior (Task 1.2).

Attack vectors tested:
1. Lock saturation: 8 concurrent write operations contending for the lock
2. Timeout granularity: 0.001s (near-instant) and 1800s (extreme upper bound)
3. Lock ordering deadlock: non-reentrant asyncio.Lock — same coroutine tries to re-acquire
4. Nested exception handling: body raises AND finally raises — only finally propagates
5. Concurrent re-acquisition after timeout: can the lock be re-acquired after a timeout?
