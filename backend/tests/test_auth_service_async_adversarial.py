"""
Adversarial security tests for async bcrypt wrapper (async_verify_password).

Tests attack vectors:
1. Timing side channels — verify timing is similar for correct vs incorrect passwords
2. Thread pool exhaustion — exhaust 4-worker pool and verify graceful degradation
3. Race conditions — concurrent password changes during active logins
4. Error propagation — bcrypt internal errors propagate correctly through async wrapper
5. Event-loop blocking — verify event loop is NOT blocked during password verification
