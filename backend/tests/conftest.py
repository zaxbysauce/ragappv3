    Many route tests call mutating endpoints (via the shared app or a

    the chat/vault/group/org/member/memory/settings routers require
    ``csrf_protect``, those requests would otherwise 403/503. The production
    frontend always sends ``X-CSRF-Token`` (axios interceptor + explicit header
    on the raw chat-stream fetch), so bypassing CSRF for tests that don't
    concern themselves with it keeps coverage honest.

    We flip ``RAGAPP_CSRF_TEST_BYPASS`` (honoured by ``security.csrf_protect``
    only under pytest) rather than per-app dependency overrides so the bypass
    also reaches the many tests that build their own app instance. Modules that
