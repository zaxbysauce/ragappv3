"""
Tests for VectorStore lock timeout mechanism (Task 1.2).

This module tests:
1. _acquire_write_lock() acquires and releases the lock correctly
2. _acquire_write_lock() raises VectorStoreError when timeout is exceeded
3. Search semaphore size matches config value
4. Config defaults: vector_search_concurrency is 16, write_lock_timeout_seconds is 30.0
5. _acquire_write_lock() correctly releases lock on exception within the async context manager block

Note: _acquire_write_lock is an async context manager (uses @asynccontextmanager), so it must be used
with 'async with', not 'async for'.
