"""
Tests for async_hash_password in auth_service.

Verifies:
1. async_hash_password() returns a valid bcrypt hash
2. Hash can be verified with verify_password and async_verify_password
3. Runs on dedicated executor thread (auth-cpu prefix)
4. Does not block the event loop — other coroutines can interleave
5. Multiple concurrent calls do not deadlock
6. Same password produces different hashes each time (bcrypt salting)
7. Works with special characters and unicode passwords
8. Original hash_password() still works synchronously (backward compat)
