"""Centralized sanitizer for user-visible assistant content.

This module is the single source of truth for stripping model thinking /
reasoning traces from any assistant text that may be shown to users or
persisted in chat history. It handles four distinct patterns:

1. ``_lhs ... _rhs`` thinking blocks (legacy Qwen tag style).
2. ``Thinking Process: ... </think>`` prefix style (qwen3.5-122b).
3. Standard ``<think>...</think>`` thinking blocks (gpt-oss-120b and others).
4. ``Thinking Process:`` followed by a ``</think>`` close even without an
   opening tag (defensive — fragmented streams may emit just the close).

All functions are idempotent: calling them twice on already-sanitized text
returns the same result.

The streaming code path additionally needs incremental, chunk-aware
sanitization which lives in ``LLMClient.chat_completion_stream`` and uses
:func:`is_thinking_open_marker`/:func:`is_thinking_close_marker` for guidance.
