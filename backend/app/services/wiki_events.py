"""In-process pub/sub for wiki compile job events.

Publishers (the WikiCompileProcessor) call ``publish(vault_id, event)`` after
a job reaches a terminal state. Subscribers (the SSE handler at
``GET /api/wiki/events``) call ``subscribe(vault_id)`` to receive a per-client
``asyncio.Queue`` of events scoped to that vault.

All operations run on the FastAPI event loop. The processor's poll loop and
the SSE handlers share the same loop, so ``put_nowait`` is safe without
cross-thread marshalling.
